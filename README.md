# Janus IDP Demo

This repository contains automation to install the `Janus IDP Demo`, as well as supporting components.

## Getting Started

Step-by-step instructions on getting Assemble running with RHSSO authentication using the included helm charts


> **_NOTE:_** For an even faster start try running the ansible playbook found [here](./ansible/README.md).

### Prerequisites

1. Openshift 4.9+
1. Helm 3+

> **_NOTE:_**  The install has been upgraded for OCP version 4.12 and above. For earlier versions there will need be some changes to the SCC settings to enable the install to work.  See the notes in the respective sections.

### Vault
Install the vault operator which will be used for the postresql password and other secrets related to Backstage. In addition applications will make use of the vault for any sensitive data.

#### Install Cert Manager Operator
The vault server uses a certificate generated by the cert-manager operator. If the operator is not already installed install the opertor.

```
# From the charts/operator directory.
helm upgrade --install cert-manager . -f ./values-certmanager-operator.yaml -n openshift-operators
```

#### Install Vault Config Operator
The vault config operator is used to manage policies and secrets in the vault instance.

```
# From the charts/operator directory.
helm upgrade --install vault-config-operator . -f ./values-vault-config-operator.yaml -n vault-config-operator --create-namespace
```

#### Install the Vault operator

> **_NOTE:_**  For OCP version 4.10 and below you must modify the file 'values.yaml' as shown below. There are seven occurrences of this in the file.
```
  privileged: false
  runAsNonRoot: true
  ## For OCP 4.10 and earlier comment out the next 2 lines
  #seccompProfile:
  #  type: RuntimeDefault
```

```
# From the charts/vault directory
# Get cluster DNS for the certificate
echo "$(oc cluster-info | grep -Eo 'cluster(.*?).com')"
helm dependency build
helm upgrade --install vault . -f ./values.yaml -n vault --create-namespace --set dns.zone='<cluster dns>'
```

### RHSSO

This section will go over how to:

1. Install the RHSSO Operator
2. Deploy Keycloak using a GitHub Client

#### Install RHSSO Operator

Log into your Openshift Cluster and run the following:

```sh
helm upgrade --install rhsso-operator charts/operator -f charts/operator/values-rhsso-operator.yaml -n backstage --create-namespace
```

#### Create GitHub Client App

Create a [GitHub OAuth Application](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) within the desired organization.  Use the following commands to generate the sample values used for this demo.

Homepage URL:

```sh
HOMEPAGE_URL="assemble-demo.apps$(oc cluster-info | grep -Eo '.cluster(.*?).com')"
```

Authorization callback URL:

```sh
AUTHORIZATION_URL="keycloak-backstage.apps$(oc cluster-info | grep -Eo '.cluster(.*?).com')/auth/realms/backstage/broker/github/endpoint"
```

Capture the Github Client ID:

```sh
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENTID>

GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET>
```

#### Deploy the RHSSO Chart

Use the following command to deploy the Helm Chart:

```sh
helm upgrade -i rhsso-backstage charts/rhsso-backstage -n backstage --set keycloak.realm.identityProvider.clientId=$GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID --set keycloak.realm.identityProvider.clientSecret=$GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET --set backstage.host="$HOMEPAGE_URL"
```

Keycloak is now configured and deployed in the `backstage` namespace in OpenShift.

#### Access Keycloak Admin Console

Keycloak Admin Console URL:

```sh
echo $(oc get route keycloak --namespace backstage -o json | jq -r '.spec.host')/auth/admin/
```

Log in to Keycloak's Admin Console using the credentials stored in the `credential-rhsso-backstage` secret.  And navigate to `credentials` tab of the `backstage` client, taking note of the newly generated secret associated with the client (this will be used later).

### Backstage

Configure Backstage and deploy to OpenShift.

#### RHSSO Configuration

Update the `values/rhsso-values.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
rhsso:
  # Generate this through the command line using
  # echo "https://keycloak-backstage.apps$(oc cluster-info | grep -Eo '.cluster(.*?).com')/auth"
  baseUrl: <BASE_URL>
  # The pre-set clientId set by the RHSSO Chart
  clientId: backstage
  # Found in Keycloak admin console, see note below
  clientSecret: <KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET>
  # Enable the backstage plugin
  backstagePluginEnabled: true
```

> **_NOTE:_** `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` can be found in the KeyCloak UI by navigating to `Clients -> Backstage -> Credentials`

#### Postgres Configuration

Postgres will work as is, but it can optionally be modified if required, view the `charts/assemble-backstage/values.yaml` file for more info.

> **_NOTE:_**  For OCP version 4.10 and below you must modify the file 'templates/postgres-ss.yaml' as shown below.
```
            privileged: false
            runAsNonRoot: true
            ## For OCP 4.10 and earlier comment out the next 2 lines
            #seccompProfile:
            #  type: RuntimeDefault
```


#### General Backstage Configuration

Fill in the companyName and baseUrl in the `backstage` section of `values/rhsso-values.yaml` updating the following:

```yaml
backstage:
  companyName: "<UPDATE_ME>"
  port: 7007
  # Generate this through the command line using
  # echo "https://assemble-demo.apps$(oc cluster-info | grep -Eo '.cluster(.*?).com')"
  baseUrl: "<BASE_URL>"
```

#### Optional: Sample Template

Deploying the Helm Chart at this point will result in a fully functional instance of Backstage.  You may wish to add a Template to the catalog for demonstration purposes.

##### Add Template

Add a sample template to the `backstage.catalog` section of `values/rhsso-values.yaml`.

```yaml
backstage:
  catalog:
    #  Add Template to the allowed types
    rules:
      - allow: [Component, System, API, Resource, Location, Template]
    locations:
      # Add reference to sample template
      - type: url
        target: https://github.com/janus-idp/software-templates/blob/main/scaffolder-templates/quarkus-web-template/template.yaml
```

For a list of additional templates and information on the Quarkus template referenced here, visit the [Janus-IDP](https://github.com/janus-idp/software-templates) organization.

##### Integrate Github

A Git Token must be included in the `app-config.yaml` in push changes into a Github Repository.

See the official [Backstage Documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/configuration#setting-up-a-github-integration) for more information on how to create one.  For the purposes of a demonstration, a Personal Access Token will do.

Add the following content to `values/rhsso-values.yaml` in order to include the git token to the config:

```yaml
github:
  enabled: true
  token: <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

> **_NOTE:_**  The token must be wrapped in single quotes, even when applying the token through an environment variable.

> **_NOTE:_**  For OCP version 4.10 and below you must modify the file 'values.yaml' as shown below.
```
  privileged: false
  runAsNonRoot: true
  ## For OCP 4.10 and earlier comment out the next 2 lines
  #seccompProfile:
  #  type: RuntimeDefault
```

#### Deploy the Backstage Chart

Use the following command to deploy the Helm Chart.

```sh
helm upgrade -i assemble-dev charts/assemble-backstage -n assemble --create-namespace -f values/rhsso-values.yaml
```

Backstage is now configured and deployed in the `assemble` namespace in OpenShift.  Access the UI through the newly deployed Route.  Log in using authentication through GitHub:

```sh
echo $(oc get route assemble-dev --namespace assemble -o json | jq -r '.spec.host')
```

### GitOps

For more advanced demos, GitOps can be used to sync templated applications to OpenShift.

```sh
helm upgrade --install charts/gitops-operator/argocd . -n assemble-argocd --create-namespace
```

### Tekton

For more advanced demos, OpenShift Pipelines can be used for CI/CD operations.

```sh
helm upgrade --install pipelines charts/pipelines-operator -n assemble-pipelines --create-namespace
```

### TBD

More information about some stuff the user can do once the Backstage UI is up.
